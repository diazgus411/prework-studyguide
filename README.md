## Usage

During this prework study guide, I learned the primary terms and language to be able to code things in general. All of the tools we used such as; HTML, CSS, GIT, and Java script, all play an important role in coding and designing webpages or just creating a code in general. All of these tools we learned factor into one another and essentially bounce off of one another, allowing us to create code that runs webpages.
